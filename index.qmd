# How to Play

## Placement Phase

Take turns placing your frogs on any lilypad with a fly.

## Movement Phase
1. Click to select a frog.
2. Click a destination to move the frog.
> Frogs follow paths but can't jump over each other.
  Lilypads are destroyed after a frog leaves.
  Collect 1 point per fly, 5 points for a lotus.
