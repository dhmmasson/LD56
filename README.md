**Fifty Six LilyPads** is my entry for Ludum Dare 56. In this turn-based game, challenge a friend or the AI by having your frogs leap between lilypads to catch flies and lotuses. Each lilypad disappears once left behind, creating a shrinking playfield! Compete for the highest score in this strategic battle as you try to outmaneuver your opponent before you run out of movement options.
